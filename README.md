# Android Calculator App

# Description
This is the first major Android app I created. I've previously did a project called StackCalculator. I've made tweaks and adjustments to the code to transpose it to an Android app. The main data structure that was used is the stack, one for the operators and one for the operands. Elements are pushed and popped depending on the conditions. This allows the application to be more powerful than a simple calculator as the user can place priority on certain operators and operands. This app also covers edge cases involving invalid expressions(i.e. (1+1))) or 1++), in which clicking equals on an invalid expression woul result in "INVALID". This is the link to the algorithm I used to help me solve this project: http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~hutchins/csci241/eval.htm

# App Demo
Complex Expression: 2^((8+32) / (156-(8+20))) + 10 = 14.0

<h3>Simple Expression: (1 + 5) * 3 = 18.0</h3>
