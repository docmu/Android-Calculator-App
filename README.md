# Android Calculator App

## Description
This is the first Android project I have created. I've previously did a project called StackCalculator, which was created using Java and Eclipse. The data structure that was used to create this calculator were stacks, one for the operators and one for the operands. Elements are pushed and popped depending on the conditions. The availability of parentheses allows users to place precedence on certain operations. This app also covers edge cases involving invalid expressions(i.e. (1+1))) or 1++), in which clicking equals on an invalid expression would result in "INVALID". This is the link to the algorithm I used to help me with the logic of this project: http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~hutchins/csci241/eval.htm  

Functionalities of the calculator includes:  
* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide
* exponent
* parentheses
* clear
* delete

## App Demo
Complex Expression: 2^((8*32) / (156-(8+20))) + 10 = 14.0

Simple Expression: (1 + 5) * 3 = 18.0
